2 implementations: samba and apache
separate users, password protect options
samba option will have to use json to track timestamps and stuff
apache version will have a database with all of that information
timestamp information will be updated every 10 seconds or something
tv shows will track time location, offer ability to skip intro
Encrypt files based on login password
apache preferred
